Data visualisation app using React, Apollo and D3.js.

Challenges i encountered by now:
  Learning and implementing Apollo to fetch data from GraphQL api.
  Learning and implementing D3 to create a simple BarChart.
  This is my first data visualisation project and D3.js is a very effective library, but the learning curve is very big.
  Making chart render after useQuery() finishes fetching all the data.
